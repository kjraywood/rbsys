=== vs Further Interference

Bidding shows extra length or strength in the suit bid, _except when
partner guarantees four-card support and forces the bidding to the
three level_.

=== Balancing

Following a balancing 1M, the unbid minor shows a good raise (like Drury).

== Two-suited overcalls (Klinger)

@ cue-bid & lowest J.O. = next 2 suits
@ 2NT = suit-below + suit-above
@ Only applies in direct seat
@ ON vs short club or diamond

=== Advancing

If the Klinger (two-suited) bid is below 2NT, then 2NT by advancer is
an Ogust-type enquiry.

| (P) | !2NT! | (P)  |  ?   | | _range-ask_

|     |       |      |  3D  | | int. (9-11)
|     |       |      |  3H  | | strong (12-14)
|     |       |      |  3S  | | huge (16+)
|===

The HCP ranges do not count queens and jacks in the side suits and are
a point or two higher when vulnerable.

When the Klinger bid is 2NT or 3C, then the cue-bid of openerâ€™s suit
asks for strength.
