== Take-out doubles

=== Raising the response

Raising a one-level response just confirms a four-card suit and a good
double.  A cue-bid might be an invitational raise so advancer can
repeat a four-card suit with a minimum.

=== 1NT response

_The higher their suit, the wider the range_

[%autowidth,cols="5*^,<",grid="rows"]
|===
| (1C) | Dble | (P) | 1NT | | 8{ndash}11
| (1S) | Dble | (P) | 1NT | | 4{ndash}10
|===

Following a 1NT response, 2M shows a big hand but #2m is to play#.

=== They bid 1NT

When they bid 1NT over our take-out double, a cue-bid of their minor
shows both majors but does not promise a good hand.

=== Strength redouble

*1__suit__  - (Dbl) - Redbl*
@ good 10{orMore} HCP
@ no fit
@ 4{orMore} cards in 2{orMore} unbid suits
@ Subsequent doubles = 4{orMore} of their suit
@ Forcing to two of openerâ€™s suit

With 4333 and a decent ten or more HCP, responder passes on the first
round, then doubles on the second round.  Opener pulls with a
singleton in their suit, or with a doubleton and five cards in the
opening suit.

=== Scrambling 2NT

@ Opps have bid to 2H or 2S
@ Partner makes a take-out double
@ RHO passes

2NT is scrambling in three situations.

==== Strictly protective auctions

Partner reopons after the opps have attempted to pass-out an uncontested auction.

But not when doubler might have a good hand

| (1C) | P   | (1S) | P
| (2S) | Dbl | (P)  | ?

The second-round double shows a good hand with length in clubs and
spade shortness, so 2NT would be Lebensohl, and a direct bid would
invite game.

==== When you or partner has bid 1NT

[%autowidth,cols="4*^",grid="none"]

|     | 1NT | (2S) | P
| (P) | Dbl | (P)  | 2NT*

[%autowidth,cols="4*^",grid="none"]
|===
|      | 1D  | (1H) | 1NT
| (2H) | Dbl | (P)  | 2NT*

==== When you have already had one chance to bid a Lebensohl 2NT

[%autowidth,cols="4*^",grid="none"]
|===
| (1S) | Dbl | (2S) | P
| (P)  | Dbl | (P)  | 2NT*
|===

You do not need two chances to show a weak single-suited hand.
