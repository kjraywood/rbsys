== Take-out doubles

=== Raising the response

Raising a one-level response just confirms a four-card suit and a good
double.  A cue-bid might be an invitational raise so advancer can
repeat a four-card suit with a minimum.

=== 1NT response

_The higher their suit, the wider the range_

Following a 1NT response, 2M shows a big hand but #2m is to play#.

=== They bid 1NT

When they bid 1NT over our take-out double, a cue-bid of their minor
shows both majors but does not promise a good hand.

=== Strength redouble

*1__suit__  - (Dbl) - Redbl*
@ good 10{orMore} HCP
@ no fit
@ 4{orMore} cards in 2{orMore} unbid suits
@ Subsequent doubles = 4{orMore} of their suit
@ Forcing to two of openerâ€™s suit

With 4333 and a decent ten or more HCP, responder passes on the first
round, then doubles on the second round.  Opener pulls with a
singleton in their suit, or with a doubleton and five cards in the
opening suit.
