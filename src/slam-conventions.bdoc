__ {nbsp}{ndash}{nbsp} Andrew Gumperz

Responder may initially conceal 4-card support for opener's major when
intending to make a picture jump to game on the second round.
It is highly unlikely that the auction will be too high for responder
to jump on the second round.

We do not conceal 4-card support in other cases because a jump to 3M
may not be available on the 2nd-round (_e.g._{thinsp} 2M or 2NT rebid
by opener).
So, contrary to the recommendation of Gumperz (part 1, page 2, hand
2), the 2nd-round jump to 3M shows strong slam-interest but !denies!
4-card support.

| 1S | 2D  |
| 2H | ?   |
|    | 3S  | strong slam-interest, 3*{S}
|    | 4S  | picture jump
|===

NOTE: Picture jumps have prioriry over kickback and minorwood to
ensure that responder's initial plan doesn't get scuttled.

=== Reverse auctions

A single-jump in opener's first suit is a picture jump; _not a splinter_.

A double-jump after a non-reverse is a splinter.

The picture bid can also be in opener's second suit, and five-card
support is needed in case opener reversed into a three-card suit.

== General Principles for RKC

=== Set trumps first

[%autowidth]
|===
| If itâ€™s possible to set a suit as trump with an unambiguous below-game
forcing-bid, then that route must be taken to ask for key-cards in
that suit.
|===

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1H |  1S   | |
| 2H |  ?    | |
|    |  2NT  | | natural inv.
|    |  3H   | | inv.
|    |  3S   | | forcing, at most a one-loser suit
|    | !4C!  | | splinter [nobr]##(#could be fake#)##
|    |  4H   | | to play
|    |  4S   | | to play
|    | !4NT! | | #natural inv.#
           [nobr]#(forcing-2NT unavailable)#
|===

In the above auction, responder can set hearts as trump with a
splinter, so cannot ask for KC on this round.
The splinter could faked just to set trump for kickback.

=== Picture Jumps have priority over KC asking

Even after suit agreement, it may be necessary to delay asking for
key-cards.

==== 2/1 Auctions

[%autowidth,cols="2*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1S |  2H   |
| 3H |  ?    |
|    | !3S!  | {S}{thinsp}({thinsp}A{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}K{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}Q{thinsp}),
               [nobr]#trump = {H}#
|    |  3NT  | natural, NF, COG, 
        [nobr]#(neither has shown 5-4{orMore})#
 2+>| 4C,4D <| slam try, trump = {H}
|    |  4S   | #picture bid#, trump = {S}
|    | !4NT! | #exclusion#, {S}-void, trump = {H}
|===

To use 4S as kickback for {H} in the above auction, responder must bid
something else first.
It should be honest in case opener takes control;
_e.g._{thinsp} a fake 3S might induce opener to think that spades are
solid, and hence convert to 6NT or 7NT.

==== Reverse Auctions

[%autowidth,cols="2*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
|  1C   | 1S |
|  2H   | 3H |
|  ?    |    |
| !3S!  |    | {S}{thinsp}({thinsp}A{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}K{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}Q{thinsp}),
        [nobr]#trump = {H}#
| !3NT! |    | mild slam-try,
        [nobr]#(opener has shown at least 5-4)#
|  4C   |    | serious slam try
|  4D   |    | serious slam try ({S} shortness)
|  4H   |    | min reverse, no help in {S}
|  4S   |    | #picture jump#, trump = {S}
| !4NT! |    | #exclusion#, {S}-void, trump = {H}
|===

As in the 2/1 auction, responder must bid something else before
bidding 4S as kickback for hearts.

For the picture jump, opener might hold
[lightgrey-bg]#{S}AQ2 {H}KQ3 {D}74 {C}AQJT5#.
The reverse into the three-card heart-suit was safe because a heart
raise by responder indicates five spades and extras (no reverse
Flannery).

=== Majors have priority over minors

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1H  | 2D | |
| 3D  | 3H | | {H} are trump
|===

A subsequent 4S (kickback) would be two-suit KC.

=== When 4NT is Selfwood

In suit-only auctions, asking for key-cards in your own suit
(selfwood) is often not possible.

4NT can be used as selfwood when: +
@ you have bid only one suit +
@ a forcing-2NT is available
_ (so a natural 4NT is not needed) +
@ you can agree partner's suit(s) with a
_ below-game forcing-bid

In the auction below, 4NT is not KC for spades because they can be set
as trump with a GF 3S.
4NT is not needed as natural because a 2NT would be forcing.
Responder has bid only one suit hence 4NT is selfwood in that suit.

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1S |  2H   | |
| 2S |  ?    | |
|    |  2NT  | | forcing (2/1 auction)
|    |  3S   | | trump = {S}
|    |  4S   | | picture bid
|    | !4NT! | | #KC for {H}# (selfwood)
|===

=== Auctions without suit agreement

==== After a jump rebid of hearts

When opener jump rebids hearts, then it's not possible to agree hearts
below game.
So 4NT is KC asking in partner's suit.

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1H |  1S   | |
| 3H |  ?    | |
|    |  3S   | | forcing, [nobr]#trumps not agreed#
|    | 4C,4D | | natural
|    |  4S   | | to play
|    | !4NT! | | #KC for {H}#
|===

Note that opener's hand strength is fairly tightly defined so a natural
4NT is not needed.

==== After a GF cue-bid

This occurs when the cue-bid is above three of opener's suit.
We treat this the same as the 3-level GF-agreement sequences; hence
minorwood is on.

[%autowidth,cols="4*^",grid="none"]
|===
| 1D | (2S) |  3S | (P)
| 4D |      |     |
|===

However, opener is forced and does not have an obvious default bid.
So perhaps optional minorwood makes sense here.

// === In competition

// In contested auction after a raise from one to two, or after a
// limit-raise, a JUMP to the cheapest unbid suit above 4m is KC asking.
// If that's not possible, then 4NT is KC-asking.

// [%autowidth,cols="2*^,<",grid="none"]
// |===
// | 1D | (P) | !2D! {ensp} (3C)
// |  ? |     |
// | 4D |     | extra length (preemptive)
// | 4H |     | KC asking
// |===

// In the above, if the interference was 3S, then 4NT would ask for KCs.

=== Optional minorwood?

Kantar treats opener's raise of a 2/1 as limited, even though it is forcing.

[%autowidth,cols="2*^",grid="none"]
|===
| 1H | 2D
| 3D | 3S
| ?  |
|===

Opener may not be able to bid 3NT or 4C, hence 4D is the default bid.
Optional minorwood might make sense here.

[NOTE]
====
*Optional minorwood:* +
4m shows slam interest.
To accept, partner bids 4m+1 to ask for KC.
To decline, partner shows KCs beginning at 4m+2.
====

=== Non-agreement auctions

4m is minorwood in the following class of auctions.

[%autowidth,cols="2*^",grid="none"]
|===
| 1D | 1S
| 3D | !4D!
|===

The characteristics are: +
@ no forcing bid below 4m that agrees m +
@ partner is limited (we are not in a GF) +
@ partner has shown length & strength
_ in the suit
@ the 4m bidder is unlimited

There are also some auctions after a 1NT opening, a jump-2NT rebid or
2NT opening where 4m is defined as minorwood. _.e.g._

[%autowidth,cols="<,^,2*<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1NT | !2NT! | | transfer to {D}
| 3C{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}3D | !4D! | |
|===

==== After 3-level rebid

[%autowidth,cols="2*<",grid="cols"]
|===
| 1S {ensp} 2C | 1C {ensp} 1D
| 2D {ensp} 3C | 1S {ensp} 3D
| ?            | ?
|===

In each of these  auctions, opener is forced.
The fourth-suit (3H) is probably the default bid but opener might
want to raise without taking control.
However, opener may also want to request key-cards.
Optional minorwood might make sense here.

In these auctions Kantar says that the jump to the
cheapest unbid suit above 4m is KC.

=== 4-level agreement


With some specific exceptions, 4m is not minorwood when it is
the first call that shows support for partner's minor.

If a minor fit is first discovered at the 4-level, and it is not one
of the specific exceptions, then 4 of the cheapest unbid-unbid suit
is key-card asking.

The KC-asking bid depends on the number of unbid suits.

@ two => lower unbid is KC +
@ one => unbid suit is KC,
_ except if clubs +
@ zero => fourth suit is KC,
except if clubs +

If diamonds are agreed and clubs is the fourth or unbid suit,
then the cheaper of each player's !2nd-suit! is KC asking.
