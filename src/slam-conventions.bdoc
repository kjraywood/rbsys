Responder may initially conceal 4-card support for opener's major when
intending to make a picture jump to game on the second round.
It is highly unlikely that the auction will be too high for responder
to jump on the second round.

We do not conceal 4-card support in other cases because a jump to 3M
may not be available on the 2nd-round (_e.g._{thinsp} 2M or 2NT rebid
by opener).
So, contrary to the recommendation of Gumperz (part 1, page 2, hand
2), the 2nd-round jump to 3M shows strong slam-interest but !denies!
4-card support.

| 2H | ?   |
|    | 3S  | strong slam-interest, 3*{S}

NOTE: Picture jumps have priority over kickback and minorwood to
ensure that responder's initial plan doesn't get scuttled.

[#picjumps-reverse]
=== Reverse auctions

A single-jump in opener's first suit is a picture jump; _not a splinter_.

[NOTE]
====
A double-jump after a non-reverse is a splinter.

The picture bid can also be in opener's second suit, and five-card
support is needed in case opener reversed into a three-card suit.

== General Principles for RKC

Four of a previously bid major is natural.
However, we use 4S as kickback for hearts when we have agreed hearts
and it when it is not a picture jump.

=== Set trumps first

CAUTION: If itâ€™s possible to set a suit as trump with an unambiguous
below-game forcing-bid, then that route must be taken to ask for
key-cards in that suit.

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1H |  1S   | |
| 2H |  ?    | |
|    |  2NT  | | natural inv.
|    |  3H   | | inv.
|    |  3S   | | forcing, at most a one-loser suit
|    | !4C!  | | splinter [nobr]##(#could be fake#)##
|    |  4H   | | to play
|    |  4S   | | to play
|    | !4NT! | | #natural inv.#
           [nobr]#(forcing-2NT unavailable)#
|===

In the above auction, responder can set hearts as trump with a
splinter, so cannot ask for KC on this round.
The splinter could faked just to set trump for kickback.

=== Picture Jumps have priority over KC asking

Even after suit agreement, it may be necessary to delay asking for
key-cards.

==== Two-over-one Auctions

[%autowidth,cols="2*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1S |  2H   |
| 3H |  ?    |
|    | !3S!  | {S}{thinsp}({thinsp}A{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}K{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}Q{thinsp}),
               [nobr]#trump = {H}#
|    |  3NT  | natural, NF, COG, 
        [nobr]#(neither has shown 5-4{orMore})#
 2+>| 4C,4D <| slam try, trump = {H}
|    |  4S   | #picture bid#, trump = {S}
|    | !4NT! | #exclusion#, {S}-void, trump = {H}
|===

To use 4S as kickback for {H} in the above auction, responder must bid
something else first.
It should be honest in case opener takes control;
_e.g._{thinsp} a fake 3S might induce opener to think that spades are
solid, and hence convert to 6NT or 7NT.

==== Reverse Auctions

[%autowidth,cols="2*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
|  1C   | 1S |
|  2H   | 3H |
|  ?    |    |
| !3S!  |    | {S}{thinsp}({thinsp}A{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}K{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}Q{thinsp}),
        [nobr]#trump = {H}#
| !3NT! |    | mild slam-try,
        [nobr]#(opener has shown at least 5-4)#
|  4C   |    | serious slam try
|  4D   |    | serious slam try ({S} shortness)
|  4H   |    | min reverse, no help in {S}
|  4S   |    | #picture jump#, trump = {S}
| !4NT! |    | #exclusion#, {S}-void, trump = {H}
|===

As in the 2/1 auction, responder must bid something else before
bidding 4S as kickback for hearts.

For the picture jump, opener might hold
[lightgrey-bg]#{S}AQ2 {H}KQ3 {D}74 {C}AQJT5#.
The reverse into the three-card heart-suit was safe because a heart
raise by responder indicates five spades and extras (no reverse
Flannery).

=== Majors have priority over minors

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1H  | 2D | |
| 3D  | 3H | | {H} are trump
|===

A subsequent 4S (kickback) would be two-suit KC.

=== When 4NT is Selfwood

In suit-only auctions, asking for key-cards in your own suit
(selfwood) is often not possible.

4NT can be used as selfwood when: +
@ you have bid only one suit +
@ a forcing-2NT is available
_ (so a natural 4NT is not needed) +
@ you can agree partner's suit(s) with a
_ below-game forcing-bid

In the auction below, 4NT is not KC for spades because they can be set
as trump with a GF 3S.
4NT is not needed as natural because a 2NT would be forcing.
Responder has bid only one suit hence 4NT is selfwood in that suit.

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1S |  2H   | |
| 2S |  ?    | |
|    |  2NT  | | forcing (2/1 auction)
|    |  3S   | | trump = {S}
|    |  4S   | | picture bid
|    | !4NT! | | #KC for {H}# (selfwood)

=== Auctions without suit agreement

==== After a jump rebid of hearts

When opener jump rebids hearts, then it's not possible to agree hearts
below game.
Therefore, #it is not possible to use kickback because it requires suit agreement.#

So 4NT is KC asking in hearts.

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1H |  1S   | |
| 3H |  ?    | |
|    |  3S   | | forcing, [nobr]#trumps not agreed#
|    | 4C,4D | | natural
|    |  4S   | | to play
|    | !4NT! | | #KC for {H}#
|===

Note that opener's hand strength is fairly tightly defined so a natural
4NT is not needed.

== Minorwood

=== Two-level agreement

#Includes artificial limit-raises below 3m.#

==== Uncontested auction

4m by an unlimited hand is minorwood except when the previous bid was
above 3m, and notrump has not been bid.

usually via a splinter.

{tab}{tab}{tab} 3S = splinter, 4S = 2 w/o

==== Unlimited hand pulls 3NT to agreed minor

If the #minor has already been agreed# then 4m by an unlimited hand is
minorwood.

Usually the 4m bidder was unable to ask for KCs the previous round
because the suit had not yet been agreed.

==== Following a transfer to a minor

[%autowidth,cols="<,^,2*<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1NT | !2NT! | | transfer to {D}
| 3C{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}3D | !4D! | |
|===

==== After a GF cue-bid

We treat this the same as the 3-level GF-agreement sequences; hence
minorwood is on.

[%autowidth,cols="4*^",grid="none"]
|===
| 1D   | (2S) |  3S | (P)
| !4D! |      |     |
|===

=== Three-level non-agreement

The general principle is that for 4m to be minorwood, we must first
explicitely agree the minor-suit, or set it as trumps with a transfer
after a notrump opening.

So when opener or responder bids a minor at the 3-level, a raise to 4m
is just forward going (forcing).

When the auction is at 3m without agreement, the KC-asking bid is
#a jump to a suit-bid below 4NT#.
In priority order the KC-asking suit is: +

@ cheapest unbid-suit
@ fourth suit
@ opener's 2nd-suit
@ responder's 2nd-suit

|===

=== Four-level agreement

When 4m is the first call that shows support for partner's minor
then, it is not minorwood.

The rules are the same as in three-level non-agreement except that
the bid is not a jump.  But it must still be between 4m and 4NT. + 

@ cheapest unbid-suit

@ opener's 2nd suit
