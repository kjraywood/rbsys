Exclusion is always a suit bid or 4NT as a kickback substitute
#between four and five of our trump suit#.

Applies when:

@ suit agreed, then jump +

== Kickback

@ 4NT replaces the kickback suit
@ asker keeps asking, teller keeps telling

=== Hearts and Spades

_When both majors are in focus, the first agreed !fit! is trumps_

If itâ€™s possible to set spades as trump with an unambiguous forcing 3S
bid, but not possible to set hearts as trump unambiguously, then a
jump to 4S by the heart bidder is kickback for hearts and 4NT is
exclusion requesting KC in hearts excluding the ace of spades.

=== Responding to the Queen Ask

Without the queen, teller returns to the trump suit

With the queen but no side kings, teller makes the cheapest bid other
than the trump-suit

With the queen and one or more side kings, teller shows specific kings
up-the-line

If the cheapest non-trump-suit bid (denying any side kings) is a suit,
then 5NT is used to show the king in that suit

// ** Need example auctions **

=== Interference

We ignore doubles of any asking or telling bids.
_i.e._{thinsp} we bid as though the double did not occur.

@ Dble = 0, 2{OrLess}, or 4 (even)
@ Pass = 1 or 3 (odd)
@ 5{S} = 2 with trump Q

Following Pass (odd) it is still possible to ask for the trump Q with double.
