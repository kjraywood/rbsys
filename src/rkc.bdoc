== Reverse Auctions

A single-jump in opener's first suit is a picture jump; _not a splinter_.

|  1D   | 1S | |
|  2H   | 4D | | {S}AQT64 {H}53 {D}KQ87 {C}J2
|===

[NOTE]
====
A double-jump after a non-reverse is a splinter.
_e.g._{nbsp}[lightgrey-bg]##1D {ndash} 1H{semicolon} 1S {ndash} !4D!##
====

The picture bid can also be in opener's second suit, and five-card
support is needed in case opener reversed into a three-card suit.

= Asking for Key Cards

== Kickback for Hearts

Hearts agreed => 4S by unlimited hand is kickback #unless it is a picture jump#

=== Both Majors

==== 2/1 Auctions

[%autowidth,cols="2*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1S |  2H   |
| 3H |  ?    |
|    | !3S!  | {S}{thinsp}({thinsp}A{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}K{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}Q{thinsp}),
               [nobr]#trump = {H}#
|    |  3NT  | natural, NF, COG, (neither has shown 5-4{orMore})
 2+>| 4C,4D <| slam try, trump = {H}
|    |  4S   | #picture bid#, trump = {S}
|    | !4NT! | #exclusion#, {S}-void, trump = {H}
|===

To use 4S as kickback for {H} in the above auction, responder must bid
something else first.
It should be honest in case opener takes control;
_e.g._{thinsp} a fake 3S might induce opener to think that {S} are
solid, and hence convert to 6NT or 7NT.

==== Reverse auctions

[%autowidth,cols="2*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
|  1C   | 1S |
|  2H   | 3H |
|  ?    |    |
| !3S!  |    | {S}{thinsp}({thinsp}A{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}K{thinsp}{or}{thinsp}Q{thinsp}), trump = {H}
| !3NT! |    | mild slam-try, (opener has shown at least 5-4)
|  4C   |    | serious slam try
|  4D   |    | serious slam try ({S} shortness)
|  4H   |    | min reverse, no help in {S}
|  4S   |    | #picture jump#, trump = {S}
| !4NT! |    | #exclusion#, {S}-void, trump = {H}
|===

As in the 2/1 auction, responder must bid something else before
bidding 4S as kickback for {H}.

For the picture jump, opener might hold
[lightgrey-bg]#{S}AQ2 {H}KQ3 {D}74 {C}AQJT5#.
The reverse into the three-card heart-suit was safe because a heart
raise by responder indicates five spades and extras (no reverse
Flannery).

==== Auctions without suit agreement

[IMPORTANT]
====
If itâ€™s possible to set a suit as trump with an unambiguous below-game
forcing-bid, then that route must be taken to ask for key-cards in
that suit.
====

If 2NT is not available or not forcing, then 4NT is natural.

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1H |  1S   | |
| 2H |  ?    | |
|    |  2NT  | | natural inv.
|    |  3H   | | inv.
|    |  3S   | | forcing, [nobr]#trumps not agreed#
|    | !4C!  | | splinter (could be fake to set trump)
|    |  4S   | | to play
|    | !4NT! | | #natural inv.#
           [nobr]#(forcing-2NT unavailable)#
|===

If forcing-2NT is available, then 4NT is self-wood (KC in own suit).

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1S |  2H   | |
| 2S |  ?    | |
|    |  2NT  | | forcing (2/1 auction)
|    |  3S   | | trump = {S}
|    |  4S   | | picture bid
|    | !4NT! | | #KC for {H}# (self-wood)
|===

When opener jump rebids hearts, then: +
@ it's not possible to agree hearts below game
@ hand strength fairly tightly defined

So 4NT is KC.

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1H |  1S   | |
| 3H |  ?    | |
|    |  3S   | | forcing, [nobr]#trumps not agreed#
|    | 4C,4D | | natural
|    |  4S   | | to play
|    | !4NT! | | #KC for {H}#

== Minors

=== Major and minor

_Majors have priority over minors_

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1H | 2D | |
| 3D | 3H | | {H} are trump
|===

We probably should use 4m as 2-suit KC.

=== Minorwood after below-game agreement

@ agreed minor-suit below 3NT
_ _(incl. via splinter)_ +
@ neither opponent bid on preceeding round +
@ 4m bidder is unlimited

[%autowidth,cols="4*<",grid="cols"]
|===
| 1D {ensp} 2D | 1C {ensp} 2C | 1S {ensp} 2D | 1D {ensp} !3C!
| 4D           | 2H {ensp} 4C | 3D {ensp} 4D | 4D
|===

[%autowidth,cols="2*<",grid="cols"]
|===
| 1D {ensp} 1S | {ensp}1D {ensp} 1S
| 2C {ensp} 3D | {ensp}2C {ensp} 3C
| ?            |    3NT {thinsp} 4C
|===

[%autowidth,cols="3*<",grid="cols"]
|===
| 1D {ensp} 1S | {ensp}1C {ensp} 1S |  1S  {ensp} 2D
| 2H {ensp} 3D | {ensp}2H {ensp} 3C | !3H! {ensp} 3NT
| 4D           |    3NT {thinsp} 4C | 4D
|===

==== Optional minorwood?

Kantar treats opener's raise of a 2/1 as limited, even though it is forcing.

[%autowidth,cols="2*^",grid="none"]
|===
| 1H | 2D
| 3D | 3S
| ?  |
|===

Opener may not be able to bid 3NT or 4C, hence 4D is the default bid.
Optional minorwood might make sense here.

[NOTE]
====
*Optional minorwood:*{ensp} 4m shows slam interest.
To accept, partner bids 4m+1 to ask for KC.
To decline, partner shows KCs beginning at 4m+2.
====

==== Minorwood to accept slam invitation

A limited hand can use minorwood when it has been invited to slam; usually via a
splinter.

3+>| 3S = splinter, 4S = 2 w/o
|===

==== After a GF cue-bid

This occurs when the cue-bid is above three of opener's suit.
We treat this the same as the 3-level GF-agreement sequences; hence
minorwood is on.

[%autowidth,cols="4*^",grid="none"]
|===
| 1D | (2S) |  3S | (P)
| 4D |      |     |
|===

However, opener is forced and does not have an obvious default bid.
So perhaps optional minorwood makes sense here.

=== In competition

In contested auction after a raise from one to two, or after a
limit-raise, a JUMP to the cheapest unbid suit above 4m is KC asking.
If that's not possible, then 4NT is KC-asking.

[%autowidth,cols="4*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
|      |      | 1D | (P) |
| !2D! | (3C) |  ? |     |
|      |      | 4D |     | extra length (preemptive)
|      |      | 4H |     | KC asking
|===

In the above, if the interference was 3S, then 4NT would ask for KCs.

=== Non-agreement auctions

==== After 3-level rebid

[%autowidth,cols="3*<",grid="cols"]
|===
| 1D {ensp} 1H | 1S {ensp} 2C | 1C {ensp} 1D
| 3D {ensp} ?  | 2D {ensp} 3C | 1S {ensp} 3D
|              | ?            | ?
|===

In the first auction, the rebid is non-forcing so it's reasonable to
use the raise as minorwood.

In the second and third auctions, opener is forced.
The fourth-suit (3H) is probably the default bid but opener might
want to raise without taking control.
However, opener may also want to request key-cards.
Optional minorwood might make sense here.

In all three of these auctions Kantar says that the jump to the
cheapest unbid suit above 4m is KC.

=== 4-level agreement

The KC-asking bid depends on the number of unbid suits.

@ two => lower unbid is KC +
@ one => unbid suit is KC,
_ except if clubs +
@ zero => fourth suit is KC,
except if clubs +

If diamonds are agreed and clubs is the fourth or unbid suit,
then the cheaper of each player's !2nd-suit! is KC asking.
