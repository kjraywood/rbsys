| 1S |  2H   | |
| 3H |  ?    | |
|    | !3S!  | | {S} A, K or Q, trump = {H}
|    |  3NT  | | natural, NF, COG, (neither has shown 5-4{orMore})
|    | 4C,4D | | slam try, trump = {H}
|    |  4S   | | #picture bid#, trump = {S}
|    | !4NT! | | #exclusion#, {S}-void, trump = {H}
|===

To use 4S as kickback for {H} in the above auction, responder must bid
something else first.
It should be honest in case opener takes control;
_e.g._{thinsp} a fake 3S might induce opener to think that {S} are
solid, and hence convert to 6NT or 7NT.

=== Reverse auctions

[%autowidth,cols="2*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
|  1C   | 1S |
|  2H   | 3H |
|  ?    |    |
| !3S!  |    | {S} A, K or Q, trump = {H}
| !3NT! |    | mild slam-try, (opener has shown at least 5-4)
|  4C   |    | serious slam try
|  4D   |    | serious slam try ({S} shortness)
|  4H   |    | min reverse, no help in {S}
|  4S   |    | #picture jump#, trump = {S}
| !4NT! |    | #exclusion#, {S}-void, trump = {H}
|===

As in the 2/1 auction, responder must bid something else before
bidding 4S as kickback for {H}.

For the picture jump, opener might hold
[lightgrey-bg]#{S}AQ2 {H}KQ3 {D}74 {C}AQJT5#.
The reverse into the three-card heart-suit was safe because a heart
raise by responder indicates five spades and extras (no reverse
Flannery).

==== Auctions without suit agreement

If itâ€™s possible to set a suit as trump with an unambiguous below-game
forcing-bid, then that route must be taken to ask for key-cards in
that suit.

This may free-up 4NT to be used as either natural or self-wood (KC in
own suit).  #We need to choose our agreement#

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]

| 1S |  2H   | |
| 2S |  ?    | |
|    |  3S   | | trump = {S}
|    |  4S   | | picture bid
|    | !4NT! | | #KC for {H} or DNE# ???

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]

| 1H |  1S   | |
| 2H |  ?    | |
|    |  3S   | | forcing, [nobr]#trumps not agreed#
|    | !4C!  | | splinter (could be fake to set trump)
|    |  4S   | | to play
|    | !4NT! | | #KC for {S} or natural# ???
|===

When opener jump rebids hearts, then
@ it's not possible to agree hearts below game
@

, so 4NT is KC.
Also, 3H
