== Rebid by responder

The following principles govern responder's second bid in an
uncontested auction that starts with three suit-bids without a raise,
reverse or jump.

* All below-game second-round jumps in uncontested auctions are natural and GF

* A second-round raise of a minor is game-forcing

* To invite, responder temporises with the cheapest new-suit
  _(artificial)_, then follows with a natural non-jump bid.

=== Example GF auctions

The fourth bid in all of the following auctions is natural and game-forcing

=== Fourth-suit forcing

@ One-round force
@ Does not promise a rebid below 2NT
@ A three-level bid by opener is forcing


=== Contested auctions

Second-round jumps and second-round raise of a minor are still forcing
if either opponent enters with a take-out double, __i.e. system on vs
double__

If either opponent has shown a suit, then the cue-bid is game-forcing
and second-round jumps are invitational, __i.e. limit bidding in
competition__

=== Responder's notrump ladder

Applies after three suit-bids without a raise, reverse or jump-shift.

@ Jump to 2NT = 13-15 or 18+
@ Double jump to 3NT = 16-17

When openerâ€™s rebid was at the two-level: (__e.g.__ after 1D-1S; 2C)

@ Non-jump 2NT = 11-12 (NF)
@ Jump to 3NT = 16-17
@ Double-jump to 4NT  = 18-19

With 13-15, responder temporises with a new suit (3rd or 4th-suit forcing).
