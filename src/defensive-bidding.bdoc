= Defensive Bidding

== Take-out doubles

=== Raising the response

Raising a one-level response just confirms a four-card suit and a good
double.  A cue-bid might be an invitational raise so advancer can
repeat a four-card suit with a minimum.

=== 1NT response

The higher their suit, the wider the range

=== They bid 1NT

When they bid 1NT over our take-out double, a cue-bid of their minor
shows both majors but does not promise a good hand.

=== vs Further Interference

Bidding shows extra length or strength in the suit bid, _except when
partner guarantees four-card support and forces the bidding to the
three level_.

== Two-suited overcalls (Klinger)

@ cue-bid & lowest J.O. = next 2 suits
@ 2NT = suit-below + suit-above
@ Only applies in direct seat
@ ON vs short club or diamond

=== Advancing

If the Klinger (two-suited) bid is below 2NT, then 2NT by advancer is
an Ogust-type enquiry.

[%autowidth,cols="5*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
|     |       | (1C) | !2D! | | majors
| (P) | !2NT! | (P)  |  ?   | | _range-ask_
|     |       |      |  3C  | | weak (6-8)
|     |       |      |  3D  | | int. (9-11)
|     |       |      |  3H  | | strong (12-14)
|     |       |      |  3S  | | huge (16+)
|===

The HCP ranges do not count queens and jacks in the side suits and are
a point or two higher when vulnerable.

When the Klinger bid is 2NT or 3C, then the cue-bid of openerâ€™s suit
asks for strength.
