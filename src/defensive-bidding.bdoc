= Defensive Bidding

== Take-out doubles

=== Raising the response

Raising a one-level response just confirms a four-card suit and a good
double.  A cue-bid might be an invitational raise so advancer can
repeat a four-card suit with a minimum.

=== 1NT response

The higher their suit, the wider the range

=== They bid 1NT

When they bid 1NT over our take-out double, a cue-bid of their minor
shows both majors but does not promise a good hand.

=== vs Further Interference

If there is further bidding by opener following our cue-bid raise,
then overcaller is not forced to bid.
We take advantage of the extra space by allowing opener to pass with
nothing particular to say.
It neither shows nor denies extra values.
Bidding when not forced shows extra length or strength in the suit
bid.

|===

==== Exception

When advancer guarantees _four-card support_{thinsp} and forces the
bidding to the three level, then further strain-investigation is
rarely needed and advancer's hand is more well defined than with a
simple cue-bid.
Thus overcaller is better placed to make decisions for the partnership
so the following applies.

* An immediate return to the trump suit shows no game interest

* A pass shows doubt, after which advancer may make a descriptive bid or
_send it back_{thinsp} with redouble

== Balancing

=== New-minor Drury after Balancing One-Major

After we balance with 1M, we use the unbid minor to show a good raise
(like Drury), and an advance in the opponent's opening-suit is natural.
This is useful because that suit was the only one that could not be
overcalled naturally on the first round.

== Two-suited overcalls (Klinger)

@ cue-bid & lowest J.O. = next 2 suits
@ 2NT = suit-below + suit-above
@ Only applies in direct seat
@ ON vs short club or diamond

=== Advancing

If the Klinger (two-suited) bid is below 2NT, then 2NT by advancer is
an Ogust-type enquiry.

[%autowidth,cols="5*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
|     |       | (1C) | !2D! | | majors
| (P) | !2NT! | (P)  |  ?   | | 2NT = range-ask
|     |       |      |  3C  | | weak (6-8)
|     |       |      |  3D  | | int. (9-11)
|     |       |      |  3H  | | strong (12-14)
|     |       |      |  3S  | | huge (16+)
|===

The HCP ranges do not count queens and jacks in the side suits and are
a point or two higher when vulnerable.

When the Klinger bid is 2NT or 3C, then the cue-bid of openerâ€™s suit
asks for strength.
