| 1__suit__ | (Dbl) | Rdbl
|===

Either good three-card raise of major, or good 10{orMore} HCP and no fit.

If no fit: +
@ 4{orMore} cards in 2{orMore} unbid suits
@ Forcing to two of openerâ€™s suit
@ Subsequent doubles = 4{orMore} of their suit

=== Pass then double

| 1__suit__ | (Dbl) | Pass

With 4333 and 10{OrMore} HCP, responder passes on the first
round, then doubles on the second round.
Opener pulls with a singleton in their suit, or with a doubleton and
five cards in the opening suit.

=== Raises

@ cue = {LRplus}

=== Negative double vs 1D or 1H

With four-card support for a major shown by responder, opener bids _as
though raising a one-level bid_.{thinsp} That is, opener bids
immediately to the two-level or higher with 4-card support.

=== Impossible 2S after negative double

Applies when a negative double shows _exactly_{thinsp} [nobr]#4*{S}#, so
that extra length is impossible.

[TIP]
====
Follows the same principle as the impossible 2{S} after a semi-forcing
NT. It shows the values for 2NT and an 8{OrMore}-card fit for
partner's last-bid suit.

=== Neg. Free Bids -- 2 other-Major

Two other-major is non-forcing when: +
@ exactly one unbid major
@ non-jump

It shows: +
@ 6{orMore}-card suit
@ 7{ndash}11{orLess}

==== Other options

Jump to 3oM  = GF, 6{orMore}-card suit. 

Neg. double = 4{or}5{xtimes}oM, no strength upper-limit.

Jump to four _lower suit_{thinsp} = fit-showing

==== Passed hand

No weak-two opening => Two  _other major_{thinsp} is usually a five-card suit.

Jump to 3oM = fit showing bid; usually 5*oM + 5*suit-of-opening bid

==== Auctions

The final bid in each line is a 2oM NFB.

A jump to 3oM would be GF with 6{orMore}, and a negative double would show 4 or 5.
