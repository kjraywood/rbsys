With 4333 and 10{OrMore} HCP, responder passes on the first
round, then doubles on the second round.
Opener pulls with a singleton in their suit, or with a doubleton and
five cards in the opening suit.

== Vs Suit Overcall
 
=== Raises

@ cue = {LRplus}

=== Negative double vs 1D or 1H

With four-card support for a major shown by responder, opener bids _as
though raising a one-level bid_.{thinsp} That is, opener bids
immediately to the two-level or higher with 4-card support.

=== Impossible 2S after negative double

Applies when a negative double shows _exactly_{thinsp} [nobr]#4*{S}#, so
that extra length is impossible.

[TIP]
====
Follows the same principle as the impossible 2{S} after a semi-forcing
NT. It shows the values for 2NT and an 8{OrMore}-card fit for
partner's last-bid suit.

When our opening was a major, then either minor = that minor
and the other major.

== Vs Two Suiters

=== Lower for Other

@ Lower of their two suits = other suit +
@@ next step by opener
__ = default (nothing more to say)

Thus there are two non-jump bids to show the other suit; a cue-bid of
the lower of their two suits, and a natural bid.

@ lower way to show other suit = invitational
@ higher way to show other suit = GF

The lower cue-bid is usually _below_{thinsp} a natural bid in the
other suit, in which case it shows invitatational values and the
natural bid, which is higher, is GF.

_e.g._

[%autowidth,cols="4*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1H | (!2NT!) | ?    | | 2NT = {C} + {D}
|    |         | !3C! | | {S} (other suit), inv. +
                          {tribull} 3{D} = default
|    |         | !3D! | | {H}, {LRplus}
|    |         |  3H  | | {H}-raise, 7{OrMore}{ndash}10
|    |         |  3S  | | {S}, GF
|===

When the lower cue-bid is _above_{thinsp} the natural bid in the
other suit, then it shows GF values and the natural bid is
invitational.

| 1C | (!2C!) |   ?  | | 2C = {H} + {S}

                         {tribull} 2{S} = default
|    |        | !2S! | | {C}, {LRplus}
|    |        |  3C  | | {C}-raise, 7{OrMore}{ndash}10
