| 2D  | | neutral, does not promise extra {D}-length
| 2M  | | 4*M + 5*{D}, extras, GF
| 2N  | | 18-19 bal
| 3C  | | hand improved by {C}-fit
| 3NT | | 18-19 bal. {C}-raise (then minorwood?)
| 4m  | | minorwood?
| 4M  | | void
|===

Following the neutral 2D, a 2NT rebid by responder shows a balanced
11-12, and permits the auction to end in 2NT, 3C or 3D
