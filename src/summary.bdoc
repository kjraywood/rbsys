|===

The HCP ranges do not count queens and jacks in the side suits and are
a point or two higher when vulnerable.

When the Klinger bid is 2NT or 3C, then the cue-bid of openerâ€™s suit
asks for strength.

== Competitive Bidding

=== Rule #1

_A call is natural and non-forcing unless defined otherwise._

|===

=== Strength redouble

1__suit__ - (Dble) - Redble

The strength redouble shows a good ten count (preferably 11) or more
and at least four-cards in at least two of the unbid suits. Subsequent
doubles by either player promise four cards in their suit.  A pass
below two of openerâ€™s suit is forcing.

With a 4333 hand and a decent ten or more HCP, responder should pass
on the first round.  A subsequent double shows high cards and three
cards in their suit.  Opener should pull with a singleton in their
suit, or with a doubleton and a five cards in his first suit.

=== Hearts and Spades

If itâ€™s possible to set spades as trump with an unambiguous forcing 3S
bid, but not possible to set hearts as trump unambiguously, then a
jump to 4S by the heart bidder is kickback for hearts and 4NT is
exclusion requesting KC in hearts excluding the ace of spades.

// Minorwood
// Four of our minor requests key-cards.  ** Need more clarification and examples here **
// Jump agreement from two to four
// Re-raise from three to four
// After suit agreement and one cue-bid below 3NT
// Pulling 3NT to four of our previously agreed minor

=== Specific Kings

The bid that asks for kings is ALWAYS one step above five of the
trump-suit.  This applies even if there is a spare step below five of
trump suit that is not needed for the the queen ask. ie. ALWAYS means
ALWAYS.

When the king-ask is a suit-bid (i.e. trumps are not spades), then 5NT shows the king of that suit.

Asking for kings promises that we have all the key-cards and the trump
queen.  This enables teller to jump straight to grand with 13 known tricks.

// ** Need example auctions **

=== Responding to the Queen Ask

Without the queen, teller returns to the trump suit

With the queen but no side kings, teller makes the cheapest bid other than the trump-suit

With the queen and one or more side kings, teller shows specific kings
up-the-line

If the cheapest non-trump-suit bid (denying any side kings) is a suit,
then 5NT is used to show the king in that suit

// ** Need example auctions **
// Interference - they double, we ignore it
// When any asking or telling bid is doubled, we ignore it.  ie. We bid as though the double did not occur.  We do not pass and we do not redouble.  We just continue our auction.
// Interference - they bid below five of our trump suit, we play D1P0
// If, following our key-card asking bid, an opponent bids something below five of our trump suit, then
// double = one or four (14)
// pass = zero or three (30)
// next step = 2 without the queen etc.
// Interference - they bid five of our trump suit or higher, we play DEPO
// Double shows Even, Pass shows Odd
// Specific Suit Asking Bids
// ** danger **
