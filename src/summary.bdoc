// -*-adoc-*-

== General Approach

@ 1NT = 15 to 17
@ 2NT = 20 to bad 22
@ Five-card majors
@ 2/1 GF
@ semi-forcing 1NT
@ aggressive preempts and pre-balancing
@ most low-level doubles are take-out

Responding to 1{C}::
Responder bypasses 1{D} when: +
@ can cope with a three-card raise
@ will rebid or raise NT

Openerâ€™s rebid with a balanced hand::
Opener usually bypasses four-card majors to rebid notrump

== 1NT Opening

=== Stayman

Promises a four-card major. +
Smolen @ 2-level for both majors except 5-5 GF +
OMaR to agree major, or show inv.{sp}2-suiter with spades

[WARNING]
====
We do NOT play delayed Texas or delayed Gerber

=== Jacoby transfers

*Super accept* = 2T + 1 +
{tab} {tribull} Responder can re-transfer or describe further +
*Transfer then 3m* is GF +
{tab} {tribull} Opener assumes COG.  New-suit agrees minor. +
*OMaR* for +

@ 3NT vs.{sp}4M COG
@ void self-splinter

=== Minor-suit transfers

*2{S} {nbsp}*= {C} weak or strong, or balanced inv. +
{tab} {tribull} Opener bids 2NT (min) or 3{C} (max). +
*2NT* = {D} weak or strong, or weak with both minors. +
{tab} {tribull} Opener bids preferred minor

Transfer to {C} then 3{D} = 5-5 minors GF. +
{nbsp}{downRA} then by opener: 3{H} => {C}, 3{S} => {D}

Transfer to minor then 3M = shortness


=== 3-level responses

3{C} = five-card Stayman + 
3{D} = at least 5-5 majors, GF +
3{H},3{S} = stiff with three in other major

=== Interference over 1NT

vs. penalty double::
Redouble forces 2{C} for pass or correct to 2{D} +
2{C} = both majors.  Then 2{D} or XX = no preference +
2{D}, 2{H} = transfers +
2{S} = four spades and a six-card minor +
2NT = both minors +
3m = six-card minor and four hearts

vs. artificial double or 2{C}::
System ON. Double of 2{C} is Stayman. We can pass to discover an
unspecified suit, then use a take-out double or Lebensohl.
+
If 2{C} is natural, double then cue (3{C}) requests a stopper

vs. 2{D}, 2{H} or 2{S} (any)::
Double by either player is take-out as though the interference was
natural.
// +
// A negative double by responder creates a competitive force and
// subsequent doubles are penalty.
// +
// After a balancing double by opener further doubles by either player
// are takeout until responder shows values by passing or making his
// own take-out double.
+
2M = to play (except when they show 5, then Michaels) +
#3m = inv.# +
3M = forcing +
3{thinsp}__cue-bid__ = Stayman, no stopper +
2NT = Lebensohl

vs. 2NT (minors)::
We play our 2NT system

== 2NT Opening

@ Regular Stayman and Smolen
@ NO delayed Texas or Gerber
@ OMaR to set trump after Stayman
@ Smolen can include 5-5 majors COG

@ 1{C}-(2{C})-2{D} = NF
@ 1{C}-(2{C})-2{H} = {D} GF

== Responder's Rebid

=== Second-round jumps and 4th-suit forcing

Uncontested::
Second-round jumps are natural and GF +
#A second-round raise of a minor is GF# +
Fourth suit or new third-suit is forcing one round

Contested::
*vs double:* system on +

| 1m   - 1{S} +
  2{H} - 2NT
| 1{C} - 1M +
  2{D} - 2oM
|===

Following a weakness signal, opener can force again by bidding above
three of the original minor.

*Reverse after 1NT response*

_e.g._{thinsp} 1{D} {ndash} 1NT; 2{H} = unbalanced raise to 2NT

Responder can sign-off in 2NT, 3{C}, or 3{D}

=== After opener raises

1m {ndash} 1M; 2M {ndash} ?

Other minor = GF, semi-natural.  Then by opener: +

{nbsp}{tribull} 3NT = 3-card raise short in other minor +
{nbsp}{tribull} 3oM = (4th suit) 3-card raise short in oM +

When opener is known to have a 4-card raise (_e.g._{thinsp} no support
double), then new-suits are natural game-tries.

Following a 2nd neg, we can stop in 3M or 4m.

== NoTrump Overcalls

*Direct* = 15-18 : Systems ON

Balancing::
@ vs. minor = 11-14
@ vs. major = 13-16
@ Systems ON

Sandwich position 1NT::
@ unpassed hand = 16-19 natural

@ Transfer to their major = inv in other major

== Suit Balancing

Following a balancing 1M, the unbid minor shows a good raise (like Drury).

..................................................

== Suit Overcalls

New-suit = non-forcing, constructive

Jump-shift = natural, good hand, but NF. Any continuation by
overcaller is forcing.

=== One Major
@ 2NT = good 4-card raise
@ Cheapest cue = most defensive raise, or some good hand
@ Jump cue = mixed raise
@ When opps bid and raise, double = responsive

=== Two-level overcalls

Responder passes::
_e.g._ {thinsp}(1{S}) - 2{C} - (P) - ? +
@ cue-bid = good constructive-raise or better
@ 2NT = natural

Responder raises::
_e.g._ {thinsp}(1{S}) - 2{C} - (2{S}) - ? +
@ double = responsive
@ 2NT = good constrictive-raise or better

Responder doubles (negative)::
_e.g._ {thinsp}(1{S}) - 2{C} - (Dble) - ? +
@ ReDble = defensive strength, no fit
@ cue = good 3-card raise or better
@ 2NT = good 4-card raise or better

=== vs Further Interference

Bidding shows extra length or strength in the suit bid, __except when
partner guarantees four-card support and forces the bidding to the
three level__.
