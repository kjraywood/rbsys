=== Strength redouble

1__suit__ - (Dble) - Redble

The strength redouble shows a good ten count (preferably 11) or more
and at least four-cards in at least two of the unbid suits. Subsequent
doubles by either player promise four cards in their suit.  A pass
below two of openerâ€™s suit is forcing.

With a 4333 hand and a decent ten or more HCP, responder should pass
on the first round.  A subsequent double shows high cards and three
cards in their suit.  Opener should pull with a singleton in their
suit, or with a doubleton and a five cards in his first suit.

=== Following our take-out double

Raising a one-level response just confirms a four-card suit and a good
double.  A cue-bid might be an invitational raise so advancer can
repeat a four-card suit with a minimum.

*1NT response:* _The higher their suit, the wider the ranger_.
