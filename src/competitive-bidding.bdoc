== Competitive Bidding

=== Rule #1

_A call is natural and non-forcing unless defined otherwise._

=== Support double

Not mandatory. _i.e._{thinsp} opener may pass with min bal. hand

*vs sandwich NT*
@ On vs unusual
@ OFF vs natural

*Responder bids*
@ two of 1st suit or lower = weak
@ above two of 1st suit = inv
@ cue = GF

=== Negative double

==== vs one diamond or one heart

With four-card support for a major shown by responder, opener bids _as
though raising a one-level bid_.{thinsp} That is, opener bids
immediately to the two-level or higher with 4-card support.

| 2S |      | 4*{spades}, minimum range
| 2H |      | GF, not 4*{spades}

=== When opps have each bid a suit

Bidding a suit we are over is natural.  Bidding a suit we are under is
a cue-bid.

|===
| 1D  | P  | (1H) | 1S
| (P) | ?  |      |
|     | 2D |      | natural
|     | 2H |      | cue-bid, good raise to 2S
|===

=== Strength redouble

1__suit__ - (Dble) - Redble

The strength redouble shows a good ten count (preferably 11) or more
and at least four-cards in at least two of the unbid suits. Subsequent
doubles by either player promise four cards in their suit.  A pass
below two of openerâ€™s suit is forcing.

With a 4333 hand and a decent ten or more HCP, responder should pass
on the first round.  A subsequent double shows high cards and three
cards in their suit.  Opener should pull with a singleton in their
suit, or with a doubleton and a five cards in his first suit.
