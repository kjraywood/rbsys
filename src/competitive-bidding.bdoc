== Competitive Bidding

=== Support double

Not mandatory. _i.e._{thinsp} opener may pass with min bal. hand

&vs sandwich NT& +
@ On vs unusual
@ OFF vs natural

&Responder bids& +
@ two of 1st suit or lower = weak
@ above two of 1st suit = inv
@ cue = GF

=== Negative double

*vs 1{D} or 1{H}*

With four-card support for a major shown by responder, opener bids _as
though raising a one-level bid_.{thinsp} That is, opener bids
immediately to the two-level or higher with 4-card support.

@ good 10{orMore} HCP
@ no fit
@ 4{orMore} cards in 2{orMore} unbid suits
@ Forcing to two of openerâ€™s suit
@ Subsequent doubles = 4{orMore} of their suit

==== Pass then double

[%autowidth,cols="3*^",grid="none"]
|===
| 1__suit__ | (Dbl) | Pass
|===

With 4333 and 10{OrMore} HCP, responder passes on the first
round, then doubles on the second round.
Opener pulls with a singleton in their suit, or with a doubleton and
five cards in the opening suit.

=== Impossible 2{S} after negative double

Applies when a negative double shows _exactly_{thinsp} [nobr]#4*{S}#, so
that extra length is impossible.

[TIP]
====
Follows the same principle as the impossible 2{S} after a semi-forcing
NT. It shows the values for 2NT and an 8{OrMore}-card fit for
partner's last-bid suit.

=== They cue-bid, we double

==== We overcall, they cue-bid, advancer doubles

When their cue-bid shows a fit, then our double also show a fit.

[lightgrey-bg]#(1{C})-1{S}-(2{S})-Dbl#
= normal raise to 2S

[lightgrey-bg]#(1{H})-1{S}-(3{S})- Dbl#
= willing to sacrifice in 4S

==== Overcaller doubles opener's cue-bid

When their cue-bid is just some good hand, then our double
is also some good hand.

[%autowidth,cols="4*^",grid="none"]
|===
|      |    | (1C) | 1S
| (2C) | P  | (2S) | !Dble!
|===

Double shows a good hand that wants to compete higher,
_e.g._ [lightgrey-bg]#{S}AQJ874 {H}43 {D}KJT8 {C}3#

==== Opener doubles their cue-bid raise

When opener doubles their (typically) fit-showing cue-bid,
it shows a good hand with support for unbid suits.  It is
like a take-out double of their bid-and-raised suit.

[%autowidth,cols="^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1D     | (1S) {ensp} P {ensp} (2D)
| !Dble! | take-out of their suit +
           _e.g._ {S}2{nbsp}{H}KJ84 {D}AKJ87{nbsp}{C}KT4

|===

[TIP]
====
Double of a low-level artificial raise means the same thing
as the double of a natural raise
====

==== We overcall, advancer doubles a delayed cue-bid

When advancer has already had a chance to show a fit, 
a double of a delayed cue-bid shows a high honour
in overcaller's suit.
The purpose is to help the defence.

[%autowidth,cols="5*^,<",grid="none"]

| (3D) | P   | 3S   | !Dble! | | Hx or Hxx in {S}
