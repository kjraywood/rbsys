TIP: We might want to lead Ax(x) or Kx in these situations

== Carding

=== Signalling

@ upside-down attitude
@ standard count
@ suit-preference in trump-suit +
@ Smith Echo vs NT
_ {ndash} rev. by opening leader

If partner leads our known 6{OrMore}-card suit:
@ middle spot-card = continue
@ hi or lo spot-card = suit-pref

=== The aggressive shift

We give attitude on opening lead, even in a suit-contract with
shortness (s|v) in dummy.
A discouraging signal implies that we can stand the aggressive shift;
usually to dummy's weakest side-suit.

We identify the aggressive shift with the following rules in order of
priority.

==== Negatives

not trumps

not a suit headed by AKQ, KQJ, or AKJT

not a singleton or void in a suit-contract except it could be a
singleton vs a slam

not a suit that was shown by declarer

==== Positives

opening-leader's suit - when a different suit was led

suit shown by leader's partner - when a different suit was led

vs suit: +
@ a 3-card suit headed by at most
_ one honour +
@ otherwise shortest side-suit
_ (but not s|v below slam)

vs notrump: +
@ shortest side-suit not excluded by
_ a negative

==== Problem hands

In third seat when you don't want the suit led, and you don't want the
aggressive shift, signal for the suit that you think is least likely
to cost a trick.

=== Exceptions to aggressive-shift signalling

trump lead {tribull} suit preference

[#signal_on_ace_lead_vs_suit]
==== A from AK vs suit contracts

At the five-level or higher, we lead K from AK, so the following only
applies at the four-level or lower.

*dummy has Qxx(x) in led suit* +
> #attitude for ruff#
_ = only encourage with a doubleton
// > count (2^nd^ highest from [T|9]xxx) +

*dummy has Jxxx(x) or Txxx(x) in led suit* +
> simple attitude 

*dummy has a stiff in led suit* +
> usually attitude, but suit-pref when dummy
_ has long trumps and equal-length side-suits

A ten is usually treated as an honour card (it might win a trick), but
when partner leads an ace (from AKx) and dummy has the guarded queen,
we treat the ten like any other spot card.
Thus from Txx we play the ten to discourage.

[#_signal_vs_nt_on_spot_card_lead]
==== vs NT on a spot-card lead

[green-box]#Updated July 6 2020#
[.nobr.green.xemph]#Clarify trick-2 signal by third hand#

If dummy is winning the trick holding Q-J-x or J-T-x, third hand gives count.

This also applies if dummy has Q-T-x, provided declarer wins the ten.

On trick two, spot cards by third hand are _suit-preference,_
#{thinsp}not Smith{thinsp}#, because attitude about the led suit
is already known.
Spot cards by leader are still Smith because leader may want the suit
continued.

TIP: If we cannot have a significant honour (J or higher) we give
     count at trick one and suit preference at trick two

=== Honour sequences

_Following suit from honour sequences_ ]
__ {nbsp}{ndash}{nbsp} Ed Zaluski

When partner leads low and we have an honour sequence, we usually play
_2^nd^-highest_{thinsp}.
However, if we know that lowest of the sequence will make our holding
known to partner, then that's the card we play.

TIP: 2^nd^ highest reveals declarer's high honours to partner.

=== Discards

Natural discards have priority.  These are: +
@ top of honour sequence +
@ 2^nd^-last in partner's suit +
@ from a five-card suit in a
_ 4-card suit of dummy or declarer

First spot-card discard is upside-down attitude unless it is in
dummy's long-suit and partner needs count.
Subsequent discards in the same suit are suit preference.

If declarer has shown out of a suit, discards of that suit are
suit-preference.

We discard immediately from a suit we cannot guard; unless it is
declarer's guess suit.

If we have a suit that is ready to run, then an immediate encouraging
discard from a side suit, shows a quick entry in that suit.

If we lead a suit against NT, declarer wins and runs a suit forcing
discards from us, including discards from the suit we have led,
then: +
@ an early discard from our led suit
_ = our suit is not ready to run
@ a late discard from our led suit
_ = our suit is ready to run

=== Suit-Preference Returns

When playing a suit for partner to ruff and dummy holds no
honour-card: +
@ Q or T = high-suit pref.
@ J = low-suit pref.

=== Getting a Ruff

When you intend to shift to a singleton and hold AKx in the led suit,
win the first trick with the ace.

TIP: By making it appear that declarer has the king, you discourage
other lines of defence.
