== Mexican 2D opening

Shows 18 to 19, balanced

=== Responses

We aim to have opener declare , so responder usually does not bid a
strain in which we are likely to play.

=== Stayman with spades

This is not five-card Stayman because: +
@ it includes 5*{S} + 4*{H} +
@ if a major-suit fit is not found, then
_ responder needs 3S as a relay to 3NT

#To show five hearts, opener bids 3NT.#

Following that, we #swap hearts and diamonds# to allow opener to
declare.

[NOTE]
====
We don't need a way for opener to show five spades because responder
has shown four.

The other Smolen-shape (5*{H} + 4*{S}) is shown with a direct 3D
(transfer to hearts with spades).

==== Special Stayman-with-spades auction

After Stayman-with-spades, followed by 3NT showing five hearts,
responder's 4H denies a fit for hearts and shows diamonds with slam
interest.

With a good hand for diamonds, opener bids the next step (4S) as KC
for diamonds, or 4NT with a poor hand for diamonds.

[#_mexican_both_minors]
=== Both Minors

==== Slam-Invitational

Responder starts with 2NT forcing 3C, then bids 3D.

TIP: The follow-ups are the same as after 1NT{ndash}3\D

Opener uses lower-for-lower in the majors to show a medium or good
hand for the corresponding minor.

==== Moderate or Slam-Drive

Moderate = invites 11-trick game, hence around 6{ndash}8

Opener must pick a minor and also indicate whether accepting or declining

[%autowidth,cols="2*^,2*<",grid="none"]

                > 4NT = kickback +
    {emsp}{thinsp}5D = sign-off +
    {emsp}{thinsp}5M = exclusion
|===

NOTE: When opener bids 4H to accept the game-inv and set clubs as trump,
      4NT forces 5C to make opener the declarer .

[#_interference_with_mexican_2d]
=== Interference with Mexican-2D

As closely as possible, we follow the same scheme as interference with
our 1NT opener.

When the interference is 2NT or lower, including double:

@ Two-level suit-bid = natural +
@ <<#_rubensohl, Rubensohl>> +
@ Texas transfers are ON +
@ **vs double:** #4C = majors# +
@ **vs major:** #4NT = minors# +
@ 4S = quant. NT raise

****
{warning}{nbsp} The meanings of 4S and 4NT are reversed compared with
interference vs 1NT, to allow opener to play NT contracts.
****

==== Vs Double

@ pass = to play +
@ redouble = rescue

Bids from 2NT to 3S are transfers to the next available strain.

*If dble shows diamonds:* +
 @ 3D = cue-bid Stayman, no stopper +
 @ #4C = majors# +
 @ 4D, 4H = Texas

*If dble = both majors, [nobr]##or dble = one unknown-major:##* +
 @ there is no cue bid

==== Vs 2H or 2S

@ Double = negative +
@ Cue bid = Stayman, no stopper +

Bids from 2NT to 3S, except for a cue bid, are transfers to the next
available strain

@ transfer to 3NT requests a stopper +
@ Texas to other major is ON +
@ [lavender-bg]#4S = quant. NT raise# +
@ #4NT = minors#

[#_rubensohl_after_mexican]
==== Rubensohl Continuations after Mexican 2D

When they interfere with 2H, we have 2S available for sign-off, so our
3D transfer-to-spades shows a stronger hand. +

After our Mexican-2{D} opening, we have less need for invitational
hands and making it GF allows us to sort out a heart stopper.

@ 1NT{ndash}(2{H}){ndash}3{D} = spades, inv{OrMore}  +
@ !2D!{ndash}(2{H}){ndash}3{D} = spades, GF +

|===

==== Opener passes the double

Opener shows a stopper.

Responder's redouble shows at least a doubleton spade allowing opener
to pass with a five-card spade-suit.
Without a spade-stack, opener resumes the normal auction by bidding
2NT.

With shortness in spades, responder takes the intended second-round
action; 3C = 5-card Stayman, 3D = transfer to hearts, _etc._

==== Opener redoubles

Opener denies a stopper so there's no advantage in having opener
declare.

[lavender-box]#Therefore the regular responses are OFF and bids in
               hearts or NT are to play.#

Playing in spades is no longer an option, but responder may still need
to know opener's heart length.

[lavender-box]#3\C asks only about heart length#

Responder's 3S, either directly or after asking for heart length, is
used to scramble to a four of a minor.

[lavender-box]#3\D shows hearts and a minor but also requires spade
               control so that opener can bid slam with a good
               minor-suit fit and sufficient key-cards#

With {H}+m but lacking spade control, responder will usually choose to
play in {H}, expecting at least Hx from opener because of the lack of
spade control.

With a single-suited slam-try in a minor-suit, responder's only options
are signing off in five minor or optional minorwood.
This decision will be guided by knowing about opener's lack of values
in spades.

      contracts

heart length.

To disambiguate responder's club single-suiters from clubs and a
four-card major, opener must show both majors at once.

=== Minor-Suit Stayman

If opener makes a positive response, then responder can use kickback
or exclusion.

[#_2nt_4c]
=== Transfer to Diamonds

We treat this like optional minorwood, one-step lower, except that
after the next-step by opener, which shows a good hand for diamonds,
responder uses kickback instead of showing key-cards.
This allows responder to use exclusion when opener likes diamonds.

_ was 4S (1 or 4) because then it is needed

However, holding the DQ, responder can ask for the queen knowing that
open will bid 5D.
Following that, responder can continue with a normal KC auction.

Shows a hand with no ace or king, or less then a good five points.

A hand with Qxx and QJxx is a good five points.

Following a 2^nd^-round neg., we can stop in 3M or 4m.

=== Special second-round positive

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none]
|===
| !2C! | !2D! | |
|  2S  | !3H! | | positive, no fit, no 5-card suit, usually 1-4-4-4
|===

=== Four-card major & long diamonds

Opener jumps to 3M on the second round to show this shape and game forcing.

To agree the major, responder bids the other minor (4C).

[%autowidth,cols="^,2*<",grid="none]

|  4H >| (M={S}) | natural, 6{OrMore}{xtimes}{H}
2+<| 4M,5D    | sign-off, neg.
|===

Using 4C to set {H} as trump, allows opener to make a
_last-train_{thinsp} slam-try.

=== Interference

CAUTION: Unusual scheme

Many use double (or redouble) to show a bust, and pass as a generic
positive.
The lack of shape info leads to awkward auctions.

We do what strong one-clubbers do.
Double shows values without length in the bid suit.
Pass is either a bust or a trap hand.

[%autowidth,cols="^,2*<",grid="none"]
|===
|    || !2C! {ensp} (X)
| ?  ||
| P  || bust or {C}-length
| XX || values, not {C}-length
|===

[%autowidth,cols="^,2*<",grid="none"]
|===
|   || !2C! {ensp} (__suit-bid__{thinsp})
| ? ||
| P || bust or length in opp's suit
| X || values, not length opp's suit
|===

TIP: This is similar to how we counter overcalls of our 1NT opening.

Opener's double or redouble is take-out unless responder has shown
positive values with a double or penalty pass.
