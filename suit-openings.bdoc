==== After 2C (four-card raise)

A four-card Drury raise (2C) can have constructive-raise (8-9) or
limit-raise (10-11) strength.

Immediately bidding a new suit above TWO MAJOR is a _second-suit
slam-try_{thinsp} showing interest based on fit.

|===

Following the range-ask, responder returns to the trump-suit with the
lower range (constructive raise).
With a limit-raise, responder shows the location of secondary values.

[NOTE]
====
3H is forcing because with a minimum 6-4 in M-m, opener rebids the major
before showing the minor.

==== Invitational raise of a 2H rebid

When opener has shown a six-card suit, the impossible 2S shows exactly
two-card support; _i.e._{thinsp} an 8-card fit unless opener rebid a
5-card suit.

[#_jump_rebid_of_original_suit_by_opener]
=== Jump rebid of original suit by opener

// Referenced from: slam-conventions.adoc#_minorwood

The Mexican 2D allows us to use 2NT to provide more definition to
opener's jump rebid.

[lavender-box]#Jump rebid of original-suit includes three-card support for
               responder's major#

Jump to 2NT shows either: +
@ a jump-rebid hand with less than three
_ in responder's major, +
*OR* +
@ a single-suited GF hand that is not suitable
_ for a jump to 3NT

==== Responder's second bid

[lavender-box]#The jump-rebid is a tight-range invitation so any below
               game bid by responder is forcing#

****
This even applies in responder's suit for which opener has shown
three-card support because it provides a convenient way for responder
to set that suit as trump for control-bidding or key-card asking.
****

A new suit above 3NT sets opener's suit as trump and is a slam try.

A new suit below 3NT could be a notrump probe, or the start of an
investigation for slam in opener's minor-suit.

Three of opener's 1st suit::
  usual meaning = natural GF (non minimum)

4th-suit::
  usual meaning = default bid, unlimited but can be minumum, hence
  F1.

==== When 4th-suit is too high

When the fourth-suit is above three of opener's first suit, we change
the usual meanings of the fourth suit and three of opener's first
suit.

This only occurs in the following auction.

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1C | 1S  ||
| 2H | ?   ||
|    | 3C  || minimum, 2{OrMore}{xtimes}{C}, attempted sign-off
|   | !3D! || GF, usually 3{OrMore}{xtimes}{C}
|===

****
If responder wants to sign-off in hearts in the above auction, then
responder must have at least five spades.
Thus responder's second bid will be 2S, intending to follow with 3H.
****

==== Opener reverses into 2\D

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<.^",grid="none"]
|===
| 1C | 1H ||
| 2D |  ? ||
|    | 2H || 5{OrMore}{xtimes}{H}, any strength
|    | !2S! || default, usually weak, F1
|    | 2NT || balanced 8{ndash}10 or 14{OrMore}
|    | 3C || 3{OrMore}{xtimes}{C}, GF
|    | 3D || 4{OrMore}{xtimes}{D}, GF
|    | 3H || 6{OrMore}{xtimes}{H}, good suit, GF
|    | 3S || splinter
|    | 3NT || balanced 11{ndash}13
|===

==== Opener reverses into 2\H

When opener's minor is diamonds, the fourth-suit is below three of
opener's suit, hence works fine as the default bid.

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<.^",grid="none"]
|===
4+^| Responder's Rebid

| 1D | 1S ||
| 2H |  ? ||
|    | 2S || 5{OrMore}{xtimes}{S}, any strength
|    | 2NT || balanced 8{ndash}10 or 14{OrMore}
|    | !3C! || default, usually weak, F1
|    | 3D || 3{OrMore}{xtimes}{D}, GF
|    | 3H || 4{OrMore}{xtimes}{H}, GF
|    | 3S || good suit, GF
|    | 3NT || balanced 11{ndash}13
|===

==== Third bid by opener

Following the default bid, opener bids the cheapest contract
that he is willing to play

=== Reverse In comp.

When responder has shown a non-bust, _e.g._{thinsp} a 1-level response
or negative double, then #a reverse in comp. is forcing for one
round.#
It does not promise a rebid as it does in an uncontested auction.

[TIP]
====
This follows the usual style of _limit bidding in competition_{thinsp}
when there's a cue-bid available to establish a GF.
====

[%autowidth,cols="<,3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
5+^| Reverse after neg. double

| 1C  | (1S) | Dbl | (P) |
| 2D* | (P)  | ?   |     | * extras, #F1#
|     |      | 2H  |     | 5-card suit, #NF# {smallnote}
|     |      | 2S  |     | cue-bid, GF
|     |   2+<| 2NT,3C,3D <| min, NF
|     |      | 3H  |     | 5-card suit, GF
|===

{note} _2oM neg.-free-bid agreements apply_

The negative double showed four or five hearts with any strength.

When opener has not shown extra +
> 2H = 5-cd inv.,{ensp}3H = 5-cd GF

Here, opener has shown extra and responder is forced to bid something.
Therefore, 2H denies more than a minimum negative double.
A jump to 3H is a GF opposite the extra strength shown by opener.

=== Reverse after 1NT response

@ one-round force +
@ does not promise a rebid +
@ shows about 16{OrMore}

Following the reverse after 1NT, responder:
@ accepts with 9{ndash}10 +
@ declines with 7{ndash}8 +
@ apologises with 6

@ 1M{thinsp}{ndash}{thinsp}2D and 1S{thinsp}{ndash}{thinsp}2H show 5{OrMore} +

[lavender-box]#After a 1H opening, responder does not bid 1S with GF
               values and only four spades.#

==== Second-round bids

Opener and responder use #next-step waiting-bids# below 2NT unless they
have something to say such as extra length, extra strength, the other
major, or a known eight-card fit.

****
Waiting bids by either player could hide a strong
hand that will bid again once game has been reached.

// __ {nbsp}{ndash}{nbsp} Andrew Gumperz

&(a) Opener's rebid&

Following a nebulous 2C, opener's jump-rebid  is NOT a splinter.
A 3-level suit-bid below 3M shows a good two suiter; at least 5-5.

[%autowidth,cols="2*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
|  1M   | !2C! | {emsp} could be short
|  ?    |      |
| !2D!  |      | [lavender-bg]#waiting, could be very strong#

2+<| [nobr]#3{lab}lower suit{rab}# <| #5-5, decent suits#
|===

&(b) Responder's rebid&

Following opener's 2D, responder shows a fit for opener's major by
skipping a step; thus bidding 2S even when opener's major is hearts.

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
|  1M   | !2C! ||
| !2D!  |  ?   ||
|       | !2H! || [lavender-bg]#waiting, could be very strong#
|       | !2S! || #{thinsp}3*M{thinsp}#
|       |  2NT || 16{ndash}17, no singleton
| 2+<| 3{lab}suit{rab} | natural, extra length or extra strength
|===

&(c) Opener's third bid&

Following responder's 2H, a second nebulous-bid, opener can bid 2S
which is another nebulous bid saying that opener doesn't want to grab
the NT.

[%autowidth,cols="2*^.^,<",grid="none"]
|===
|  1M   | !2C! |
| !2D!  | !2H! |
|  ?    |      |
| !2S!  |      | usually min. hand that doesn't want
                 to bid NT, but very-strong hand is possible
| 2NT   |      | usually 12-14, but 18-19 with 5-2 majors
                 is possible
| 3m    |      | 4*m,  15{OrMore}
|===

| !3NT! |  ?   ||

=== Fourth suit at the 4-level

There is one three-suit auction without a jump, in which the fourth suit
is at the four level.

[%autowidth,cols="2*^",grid="none"]
|===
| 1S |  2H
| 3D |  4C
|===

The normal meaning of fourth-suit on the second-round in 2/1 auctions
is that responder unable to bid notrump and has no other good bid.
The problem in the above auction is obvious; the fourth suit is above
3NT which might be the best spot.

Therefore, we swap the meaning 3S and 4C at responder's second bid.

[%autowidth,cols="2*^,2*<",grid="none"]
|===
4+^| Fourth suit at the 4-level

| 1S |  2H  ||
| 3D |  ?   ||
|    |  3H  || normal rebid, 6{OrMore}{xtimes}{H}, good{nbsp}suit
|    | !3S! || #need help in 4th-suit (clubs) for NT#
|    |  3NT || to play
|    | !4C! || #3{xtimes}{S}, says nothing about clubs#
|===

The remaining 4-level bids are:

[%autowidth,cols="2*^,2*<",grid="none"]
|===
| {tab}  |  4D  || natural diamond raise
|        | !4H! || last-suit kickback, for {D}
|        |  4S  || picture bid
|        |  4NT || natural

 __ {thinsp}{picbid1}[Part 1], {picbid2}[Part 2], {picbid3}[Part 3]
__ {nbsp}{ndash}{nbsp} Andrew Gumperz

[lavender-box]#A picture bid is a jump to game in partner's major-suit
               after having bid new suit#

Responder may initially conceal 4-card support for opener's major when
intending to make a picture jump to game on the second round.
It is highly unlikely that the auction will be too high for responder
to jump on the second round.

We do not conceal 4-card support in other cases because a jump to 3M
may not be available on the 2^nd^-round (_e.g._{thinsp} when open
rebids 2M or 2NT).  A 2^nd^-round jump to 3M !denies! 4-card support.
This is contrary to the recommendation of Gumperz for bidding the
South hand on page 2.

[lavender-box]#Picture bids have priority over kickback#

[%autowidth,cols="3*^,<",grid="none"]
|===
| 1S | 2H   ||
| 3H | !4S! || picture bid
|===

To use kickback in hearts, responder can first bid 3S, artificial
non-serious slam-try, then follow with 4S.
